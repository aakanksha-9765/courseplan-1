![Password](images/password.png)

* For example, the password is set as 123 by the user while
registration.
* First, the block number containing the first digit is checked. 
* It is present in block 1, then the number to be added to the first digit is checked in the given square boxes below. 
Suppose 1 is to be added to the block according to the given box below, the total would be (Block_1 + ADD_1) = 2.
Hence block 2 should be clicked for the first digit to be entered.
* This process is continued for the remaining digits entry.
* If the sum of the number exceeds the number of blocks present, the count should be started from block 1 again.
For example, if the sum is 6, and the blocks present are only 4, block 2 should be clicked.
